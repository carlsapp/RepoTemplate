Choosing a License
==================

The choice of a license for your project is an important decision. We recommend
using the resources at http://choosealicense.com/ to make an educated choice.
Once you have chosen a license, the following modifications need to be made if
you are using anything other than the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL):

#. Modify the :file:`LICENSE` file to include the new license.
#. Modify all source files to include the license summary.
#. Update :file:`docs/license.txt` to include details about the license.
