The repository template provides everything necessary to get a new open source
project up and running in as little time as possible. The template provides
code snippets, generic documentation, a webpage template, and the folder
structure suitable for most open source projects. If you'd like to use this
template for your open source project, start by looking at the
:ref:`Getting Started` section. If you're interested in contributing to this
project, take a look at the :ref:`Contributing` section.
