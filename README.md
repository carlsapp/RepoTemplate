# New Project Template
This repo is a template for quickly starting new open source programming
projects. The goal is to have everything you may need to publish the project to
the world already written and available. After you copy this repo, you will
want to modify this section to give an overview of the project. For this
version of the file, we'll provide some links to help you write better Markdown (md) files:

* [GitHub's Mastering Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [A Great Markdown Cheatsheet by Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
