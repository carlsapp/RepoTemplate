# New Project Template
This repo is a template for quickly starting new open source programming projects. The goal is to have everything you may need to publish the project to the world already written and available. After you copy this repo, you will want to modify this section to give an overview of the project. For this version of the file, we'll provide some links to help you write better Markdown (md) files:

* [GitHub's Mastering Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [A Great Markdown Cheatsheet by Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

# Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with using this New Project Template is to click the green "Clone or download" drop-down menu in the upper right and choose "Download ZIP". Unzip the files and open a command prompt in the folder. The most basic usage of this script is:

    > python MyPythonScript.py
    This is some pretty output from my Python script

For more detailed usage, take a look at the `MyPythonScript.py --help` output. For API details and more complex example, take a look at the usage documentation (insert link to Usage section of docs when available).

# Features
This section needs to be moved to the documentation. But, we'll leave it here until the documentation folder and files get created.

# Task List
This is a quick list of changes that I want to make to this template repo.
* Add all of the pieces recommended on this page: https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/
* Add a starter docs folder with sphinx style markup that could be loaded by ReadTheDocs.org
* Add a version.txt file and documentation saying we follow http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
* Add template files for all of the major languages that give examples for coding style, documentation, etc.
* In the contributing section of the docs, talk about coding style, code of conduct, how to push change proposals, branch strategy, etc.
* In the getting started section of the docs, talk about how someone can get help or file an issue.
* Integrate the files for Python distributing following https://packaging.python.org/ and https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject
