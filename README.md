# New Project Template
This repo is a template for quickly starting new open source programming
projects. The goal is to have everything you may need to publish the project to
the world already written and available. After you copy this repo, you will
want to modify this section to give an overview of the project. For this
version of the file, we'll provide some links to help you write better Markdown (md) files:

* [GitHub's Mastering Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
* [A Great Markdown Cheatsheet by Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

# Getting Started
The easiest way to get started with using this Repo Template is to click the
green "Clone or download" drop-down menu in the upper right and choose
"Download ZIP".

Unzip the files and open a command prompt in the folder. The most basic usage
of this script is:

    > python MyPythonScript.py
    This is some pretty output from my Python script

For more detailed usage, take a look at the `MyPythonScript.py --help` output.
For API details and more complex examples, take a look at the usage
documentation (insert link to Usage section of docs when available).

This section needs to be moved to the documentation. But, we'll leave it here until the documentation folder and files get created.
