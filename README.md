# Task List
This is a quick list of changes that I want to make to this template repo.
* Add all of the pieces recommended on this page: https://opensource.guide/starting-a-project/
* Add a starter docs folder with sphinx style markup that could be loaded by ReadTheDocs.org
* Add a version.txt file and documentation saying we follow http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html
